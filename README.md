Sorting Algorithms
Four sorting algorithms are implemented as static methods within the StudentSorter class:
1.	Bubble Sort:
o	This method iteratively compares adjacent elements in the array and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted in descending order of GPA.
2.	Selection Sort:
o	This method repeatedly selects the student with the highest GPA from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element. This process continues until the array is sorted.
3.	Insertion Sort:
o	This method builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking the next element and inserting it into the correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.
4.	Merge Sort:
o	This method recursively divides the array into smaller subarrays until each subarray contains a single element. It then merges the subarrays back together in the correct order to form a sorted array.
Displaying Results
After sorting, the sorted list of students is displayed, showing their names and GPAs in descending order. The user is then prompted to press any key to return to the menu.
Conclusion
The application provides a user-friendly interface for selecting and applying different sorting algorithms to a list of students. By implementing multiple sorting algorithms, the code demonstrates fundamental sorting techniques and allows for comparison of their implementations and performance.
